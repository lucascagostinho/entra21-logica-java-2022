# Ternary Operator

> Java ternary operator is the only conditional operator that takes three operands. Itâ€™s a one-liner replacement for the if-then-else statement. We can use the ternary operator in place of if-else conditions or even switch conditions using nested ternary operators. Although it follows the same algorithm as of if-else statement, the conditional operator takes less space and helps to write the if-else statements in the shortest way possible.

```java
num1 = 10;
num2 = 20;
res=(num1>num2) ? (num1+num2):(num1-num2)
/*Since num1<num2, the second operation is performed: res = num1-num2 = -10*/
```
