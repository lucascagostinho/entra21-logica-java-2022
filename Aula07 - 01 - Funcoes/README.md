# Methods in Java

>A method in Java or Java Method is a collection of statements that perform some specific task and return the result to the caller. A Java method can perform some specific task without returning anything. Methods in Java allow us to reuse the code without retyping the code.

## Method Declaration:

> - general, method declarations has six components :  

> - 1 - Modifier: It defines the access type of the method i.e. from where it can be accessed in your application. In Java, there 4 types of access specifiers. 
> - - public: It is accessible in all classes in your application.
> - - protected: It is accessible within the class in which it is defined and in its subclass/es
> - - private: It is accessible only within the class in which it is defined.
> - - default: It is declared/defined without using any modifier. It is accessible within the same class and package within which its class is defined.
  
> - 2 - The return type: The data type of the value returned by the method or void if does not return a value.

> - 3 -  Method Name: the rules for field names apply to method names as well, but the convention is a little different.

> - 4 -  Parameter list: Comma-separated list of the input parameters is defined, preceded with their data type, within the enclosed parenthesis. If there are no parameters, you must use empty parentheses ().

> - 5 - Exception list: The exceptions you expect by the method can throw, you can specify these exception(s).
> - 
> - 6 - Method body: it is enclosed between braces. The code you need to be executed to perform your intended operations.
