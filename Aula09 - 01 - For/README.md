# For loop

>Java for loop provides a concise way of writing the loop structure. The for statement consumes the initialization, condition and increment/decrement in one line thereby providing a shorter, easy to debug structure of looping.
```java
for (initialization expr; test expr; update exp){
     // body of the loop
     // statements we want to execute
}
