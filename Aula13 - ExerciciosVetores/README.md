# Exercises using array

1. Create a java project where main should serve as a menu for each execution of the exercises.

> The program only closes when choosing "EXIT" or 0;
> Before ending the execution, thank the user for using the program;
> Switch cases should not be complex, should call specific methods.
> <br>

Options in the menu:
(Remember to check all the options in the DEBUG perspective)

> 1- Create arrays for each primitive type and display their size in the console;
> 2- Create initialized arrays for each primitive type and display their size in the console;
> 3- Create 1 array of 5 positions, for the user to feed these values;
> 4- Create an array with the size informed by the user and then ask the user to inform the respective values;
> 5- Create an initialized array of integers, to traverse:
> from start to finish, from end to beginning and to display the values;
> 6 - Create an uninitialized array of integers.Repeat indefinitely until the user answers no to the question
> "Would you like to initialize the value of one of the positions between 1 and SIZE?"
> If the answer is "yes", capture a position. Retry capture while index is not valid. If the answer is "no", exit and display all array values.
