# Arithmetic Operators

> - Arithmetic operators perform fundamental math operations between two variables and return the result. If it is necessary to write larger or more complex operations, we can combine these operators and create expressions, which allow us to programmatically perform all kinds of calculations.


 |Operator |Operation|
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| + | Addition     |
| - | Subtraction   |
| * | Multiplication     |
| / | Division     |
| % | Modulo Operation or Remainder after division|

### Examples

```java    
    // declare variables
    int a = 6, b = 3;
    // addition operator
    System.out.println("a + b = " + (a + b));
    // subtraction operator
    System.out.println("a - b = " + (a - b));
    // multiplication operator
    System.out.println("a * b = " + (a * b));
    // division operator
    System.out.println("a / b = " + (a / b));
    // modulo operator
    System.out.println("a % b = " + (a % b));
```
